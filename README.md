A PyTorch library for Spiking Dendrite-Enabled neurons. This library implements a hardware-aware Dendrite within PyTorch, for use with the SNNTorch library or as a stand-alone PyTorch module.

## Overview

TorchDendrite is a module that implements a hardware-inspired dendritic cable function using Pytorch and SNNtorch. The module contains trainable parameters and is compatible with both spiking and non-spiking neural networks.
